Running the Test: The website will explain to you about the product, its features , pricing and it also includes a Webchat bot to know more about the product. 

Our product is an amalgamation of an automated sanitizer dispenser and a temperature sensor. This device is connected to automated doors in malls, shops, or any publicly accessible building. 

Now, why did we choose this product?
1. Reduces the wastage of sanitiser
2. Reduces human contact
3. Reduces the risk of exposure to the virus
4. Increases efficiency (humans are prone to make errors while checking the temperature and comparing it to the recommended values)
5. Multitasking (Fulfils the purpose of both sanitiser dispenser and temperature sensor)
6. Compatible for any kind of automated door systems. 
7. most zero to none contact with surfaces. 

About the website:
1. Our website has the description, working and pricing of our product.
2. It also provides you with the product design and prototype of our product.
3. It also has an inbuilt chat bot that will help you with queries regarding the product and the website.
